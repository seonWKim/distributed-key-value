# Chapter 2: Data Partitioning

This chapter focuses on building efficient and scalable **data partitioning strategies** across distributed nodes. You will implement patterns commonly used in real-world distributed databases like Cassandra, MongoDB, and DynamoDB.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ What We Will Learn

In this chapter, you'll gain hands-on understanding of:

- âœ… **Hash-based Partitioning** for even data distribution
- âœ… **Range-based Partitioning** for ordered data access
- âœ… **Partition Mapping** to cluster nodes or shards
- âœ… **Coordinator Nodes** for routing client requests
- âœ… **Two-Phase Commit (2PC)** for atomic cross-partition operations
- âœ… **Isolation Levels** in distributed transactions
- âœ… **Consistent Hashing** for minimizing rebalancing
- âœ… **Partition Rebalancing** strategies
- âœ… **Hot Spot Detection and Mitigation**
- âœ… **Partition-aware Request Routing**

---

## ðŸ›  What We Will Implement

You will **implement and test** the following components and behaviors:

### âœ… Core Mechanisms

- **Hash-based Partitioner**  
  A component that distributes data evenly across partitions using key hashing.

- **Range-based Partitioner**  
  A component that maintains key ordering for efficient range queries.

- **Partition-to-Node Mapping**  
  A registry that tracks which nodes own which partitions.

- **Request Coordinator**  
  A component that routes requests to the appropriate partition.

- **Cross-Partition Transaction Coordinator**  
  Implements two-phase commit for atomic operations across partitions.

### âœ… Advanced Mechanics

- **Consistent Hash Ring**  
  A mechanism that minimizes data movement when nodes join or leave.

- **Partition Rebalancer**  
  A component that redistributes partitions when cluster topology changes.

- **Hot Spot Detector**  
  A monitoring system that identifies and reports partition access patterns.

- **Isolation Level Manager**  
  A component that enforces different isolation guarantees for transactions.

## ðŸ“˜ How We Should Learn This Chapter

This chapter is divided into incremental exercises that build on top of each other:

1. **Start with Basic Partitioning**
  - Implement simple hash and range partitioners.

2. **Add Partition-to-Node Mapping**
  - Build a registry to track partition ownership.

3. **Implement Request Routing**
  - Create a coordinator to route requests to the right partition.

4. **Add Cross-Partition Transactions**
  - Implement two-phase commit for atomic operations.

5. **Enhance with Consistent Hashing**
  - Minimize data movement during cluster changes.

6. **Test Everything with Cluster Changes**
  - Add/remove nodes, rebalance partitions, handle hot spots.

## ðŸ§ª Suggested Tools & Practices

- Use **JUnit** for testing partition distribution and rebalancing.
- Simulate cluster topology changes to test rebalancing.
- Implement metrics to track partition access patterns.
- Use visualization tools to understand partition distribution.

## ðŸš€ Outcome

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:

- Implement different partitioning strategies for distributed data
- Design efficient request routing mechanisms
- Handle atomic operations across multiple partitions
- Manage partition rebalancing during cluster changes
- Identify and mitigate hot spots in your data distribution
