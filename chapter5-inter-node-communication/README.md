# Chapter 5: Inter-Node Communication

This chapter focuses on building efficient and reliable **communication mechanisms between distributed nodes**. You will implement patterns commonly used in real-world distributed systems like Cassandra, Kafka, and gRPC-based services.

## ðŸŽ¯ What We Will Learn

In this chapter, you'll gain hands-on understanding of:

- âœ… **Single TCP Socket Channel** for efficient communication
- âœ… **Request Batching** for improved throughput
- âœ… **Asynchronous Communication** patterns
- âœ… **Flow Control** mechanisms
- âœ… **Backpressure** handling
- âœ… **Protocol Buffers** for efficient serialization
- âœ… **Connection Pooling** for resource management
- âœ… **Request Pipelining** for latency reduction
- âœ… **Compression** techniques
- âœ… **Fault Tolerance** in communication

## ðŸ›  What We Will Implement

You will **implement and test** the following components and behaviors:

### âœ… Core Mechanisms

- **Single Socket Channel**  
  A persistent TCP connection between nodes for efficient communication.

- **Batch Request Handler**  
  A component that groups multiple requests into a single network operation.

- **Asynchronous Communication Manager**  
  A system for non-blocking request-response patterns.

- **Protocol Buffer Serializer**  
  An efficient binary serialization mechanism for messages.

- **Connection Pool**  
  A manager for multiple connections to improve throughput and reliability.

### âœ… Advanced Mechanics

- **Request Pipeline**  
  A mechanism to send multiple requests without waiting for responses.

- **Flow Control System**  
  A component that prevents overwhelming receivers with too many messages.

- **Backpressure Handler**  
  A mechanism to signal when a node is overloaded.

- **Compression Manager**  
  A component that reduces message size for efficient network usage.

- **Fault-Tolerant Communication**  
  Mechanisms for handling network failures and retries.

## ðŸ“˜ How We Should Learn This Chapter

This chapter is divided into incremental exercises that build on top of each other:

1. **Start with Basic Socket Communication**
  - Implement a simple TCP socket channel.

2. **Add Request Batching**
  - Group multiple requests into single network operations.

3. **Implement Asynchronous Communication**
  - Build non-blocking request-response patterns.

4. **Add Protocol Buffer Serialization**
  - Implement efficient binary serialization.

5. **Enhance with Flow Control and Backpressure**
  - Prevent overwhelming receivers with too many messages.

6. **Test with Network Failures**
  - Simulate network issues to test fault tolerance.

## ðŸ§ª Suggested Tools & Practices

- Use **JUnit** for testing communication components.
- Implement metrics to track throughput, latency, and error rates.
- Simulate network conditions like high latency and packet loss.
- Use tools like Wireshark to analyze network traffic.

## ðŸš€ Outcome

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:

- Implement efficient communication channels between distributed nodes
- Design systems that handle high throughput with low latency
- Build fault-tolerant communication mechanisms
- Optimize network usage with batching and compression
- Create backpressure mechanisms to handle overload situations
